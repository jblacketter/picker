# Review Summary - Finnhub Integration
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Developer:** Claude (Anthropic)
**Reviewer:** Jack Blacketter

---

## Codex Review ‚Äì 2025-10-30

### Blocking Issues
- `strategies/views.py:118` reuses `validate_question()` to request full trade analysis. The live and stub Claude clients only return `{ "valid": bool }`, so movers end up with `{"valid":true}` instead of actionable research. Please switch to `generate_response()` (or add a dedicated method) before we rely on these insights.

### High-Priority Follow-ups
- `requirements.txt` is missing `requests`, but `strategies/finnhub_service.py` imports it. The integration will crash in fresh environments until we add the dependency.
- Sensitive tokens are checked into docs (`docs/FINNHUB_INTEGRATION.md:49`, `docs/CHANGES_2025-10-29.md:63-68`). We should scrub/rotate the Finnhub API key and webhook secret ASAP and update the docs to reference environment variables instead.

### Questions / Clarifications
- Should we persist the Finnhub article metadata (timestamp, category) on `PreMarketMover` so we can surface it in the UI and future analytics work?
- Are we comfortable logging full Finnhub payloads at info level, or do we want to dial that back once we go live?

## Questions for Review

### Immediate Questions
1. **Does the auto-news feature work as expected?**
   - Test by tracking a stock and checking if real news appears

2. **Is the news quality good enough?**
   - Are the headlines relevant?
   - Do the sources make sense?

3. **Any bugs or issues during testing?**

### Strategic Questions
4. **Which Phase should we build next?**
   - Phase 2 (Morning Scanner)?
   - Phase 4 (Enhanced AI)?
   - Something else?

5. **Watchlist management:**
   - Should watchlists be hardcoded or user-configurable?
   - Database model vs settings file?

6. **News filtering:**
   - Should we filter out irrelevant news?
   - Minimum relevance score?
   - Only show <24 hour news?

7. **AI analysis scope:**
   - Keep it concise (2-3 sentences)?
   - Or expand to detailed entry/exit plan?

8. **Historical data retention:**
   - Keep all movers forever?
   - Archive after 30 days?
   - Delete after 90 days?
