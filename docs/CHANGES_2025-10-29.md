## Finnhub API Integration - Automated News Fetching

### Summary
Integrated Finnhub API to automatically fetch news for tracked stocks, eliminating manual news entry and improving AI analysis quality.

### What Changed

**New Features:**
1. **Auto-News on Track** - When you click "+ Track" from scan results, news is automatically fetched and populated
2. **Auto-News on Research** - When you click "Research This", generic headlines are automatically updated with real news
3. **Better AI Analysis** - Claude AI now receives actual news context for better trading insights

**New Files:**
- `strategies/finnhub_service.py` - Finnhub API client with news, quotes, and market status functions

**Modified Files:**
- `config/settings.py` - Added `FINNHUB_API_KEY` setting
- `.env` - Added Finnhub API key configuration
- `strategies/views.py` - Updated `quick_add_mover()` and `analyze_mover()` to auto-fetch news

### Testing Status
✅ All tests passing
✅ API connection verified
✅ End-to-end workflow validated
✅ Error handling confirmed

### How to Test

1. **Start the server:** `python manage.py runserver`
2. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:8000/strategies/pre-market-movers/
3. **Scan symbols:** Enter symbols like "AAPL,TSLA,NVDA,MSFT" and click "Scan for Movers"
4. **Track a stock:** Click "+ Track" on any result
5. **Verify:** Check that the news headline, source, and URL are automatically populated (not "Pre-market movement: X%")
6. **Research:** Click "Research This" to trigger AI analysis with real news context

### What's Next

**Phase 2: Automated Morning Scanner** (Planned)
- Django management command to run at 8:00 AM
- Automatically scans watchlist and identifies movers
- Email/notification summary

**Phase 3: Market Status Detection** (Planned)
- Display current market session (pre/regular/post/closed)
- Adapt scanning behavior per session

**Phase 4: Enhanced AI Analysis** (Planned)
- Entry/exit price targets
- Stop loss recommendations
- Risk/reward ratios
- Confidence levels

## API Configuration

**Finnhub API Key:** Configured in `.env`
```bash
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
```

**Finnhub Webhook Secret:** (for future real-time alerts)
```bash
FINNHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_finnhub_webhook_secret_here
```

## Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `strategies/finnhub_service.py` | +257 (new) | Finnhub API client |
| `strategies/views.py` | ~40 | Auto-fetch news logic |
| `config/settings.py` | +3 | API key configuration |
| `.env` | +3 | Environment variables |

**Total Impact:** ~300 lines of new code

---

## Performance Impact

**API Calls Per Action:**
- Quick Add (+ Track): 1 call to Finnhub
- Research This: 1 call to Finnhub (if needed)
- Morning Scanner: ~50-100 calls (planned)

**Rate Limits:** 60 calls/min (well within limits)

**Response Time:** ~200-500ms per news fetch (negligible UX impact)

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes**
- Existing manual add workflow still works
- News auto-fetch is additive, not replacing
- Graceful fallback if Finnhub fails
- No database migrations required

---

## Known Issues

None - all functionality working as expected.

## Questions for Review

1. Should we make the news source (Finnhub vs manual) visible in the UI?
2. Should we cache news for X minutes to reduce API calls?
3. Should the automated scanner send email or just populate the dashboard?
4. What symbols should be in the default watchlist for morning scanning?
5. Should we add a "Refresh News" button for manual re-fetching?
