Create a new Django app in this project.

Ask me for the app name, then:
1. Run `python manage.py startapp <app_name>`
2. Add it to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
3. Create basic models.py template
4. Create urls.py for the app
5. Register the app URLs in the main urls.py

Show me what was created and guide me on next steps.
