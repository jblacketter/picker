Start the Django development server.

```bash
# Default port (8000)
python manage.py runserver

# Or specify a different port if 8000 is in use
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

Common ports if 8000 is taken by Apache:
- 8080, 8888, 3000, 5000, 9000

Tell me when the server is ready and provide the URL to access it.
